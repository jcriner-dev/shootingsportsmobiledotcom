    <h1 class="title"> April IDPA Match</h1>
    <p class=date> 14 Apr 2013 </p>
    <p>During last month's debrief, we realized that there was a dilemma running both paper and the electronic scoring system. While it was a good thing that we had a backup to check results, it turned out that most of the errors occured because the person running the tablet did not feel solely responsible for scoring the stage and may not have double checked their entries. This month everyone got thrown in to the deep end and we ditched the paper.  All shooters were offered paper scoresheets to keep for themselves, and everyone declined!</p>
<p>While it wasn't safest move from a technical point of view, it all worked out and had several positive outcomes. First, the timer SO and the scorekeeper SO developed better communication without the third person being involved. Second, the scorekeeper SO became more responsible and stopped scoring to correct typos before moving on. Third, shooters became much more interested in confirming their scores on the stage knowing there wasn't a paper backup and that they had declined to keep their own score.</p>
<p>Signup went smoothly, eight (8) squads completed eight (8) stages, and results were emailed out within 30 minutes after the last shot was fired.</p>
