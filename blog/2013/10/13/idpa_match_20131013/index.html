    <h1 class="title"> October IDPA Match</h1>
    <p class=date> 13 Oct 2013 </p>
    <p>Seven (7) squads on eight (8) stages, and nine (9) more classifiers. No issues.</p>
<p>We made use of categories during the signup process and for the match report. Things worked well and it didn't slow down the signup process one bit. However, there were two (2) recurring comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>"First Responders" might be more inclusive than just "Law Enforcement".</li>
<li>The language in the 2013 rules (1.2.4.8), "active or retired military" led to almost all of our military veterans saying they didn't qualify because they were neither "active" or "retired" in the sense that they had put in 20 years. Whatever the original intent, we felt any military veteran had more than earned their recognition in the category and went with "active military or veteran". It just seemed like the right thing to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this was the last match of the 2013 outdoor season, we needed to finalize season standings for awards before the banquet after the match. That's were the scoring system really paid off. Match results, season standings, and award plaques were all done before the props were put away in the barn.</p>
<p>It was a great season and many thanks go out to all of our shooters and safety officers for making the new scoring system work.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone, and see you next year!</p>
